# Basic Example
In this example we create a simple standalone nodeJS server with tRPC and connect it to a vue frontend. 
It uses a single query procedure as well as a websocket based subscription

## Running the example
This example is a workspace in the use-trpc repo, so its dependencies npm installed when running `npm i` at the root. 

Then open two prompts and run the client and the server

## Running the Client

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running the Server

```bash
npm start
```
